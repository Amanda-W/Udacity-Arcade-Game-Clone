===============================

*Summary*: The point of this game is to move the player from the grassy area, across the cobblestone, and onto the safe water beyond. You will begin by using the arrow keys on the keyboard to move your player up, down, left, and right. You will need to navigate the enemy bugs running across the cobblestone. If your player happens to collide with any of said enemy bugs, your player will be reset and placed right back where you started on the grassy knoll. When you successfully navigate your player to the water, a winning modal will pop up to let you know you won. The player will then be reset upon exit of the modal.
